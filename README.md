# Pi-MobiSec - Secure your Laptop while using unsecure hotspots

Secure your laptop while using public wifi hotspots.  Instead of connecting your laptop directly with public wifi hotspots, you connect your Pi-MobiSec device with it and let it filter and protect the traffic going in and out of your laptop.

Pi-MobiSec turns your Raspberry Pi Zero W (others will be supported in the near future) into a mobile firewall protecting your computer and optionally your traffic while you are using unsecure or public hotspots.
